    Use nanny or not:

    'false': causes ifup (and ifreload) to apply the config
	     directly into wickedd without nanny involved
	     (one shot setup).

    'true':  causes ifup (and ifreload) to apply a policy
	     with the effective config to nanny and nanny
	     configures wickedd then; with hotplug support.

    After a change, restart wickedd.service and execute
    "wicked ifup all" to (re)apply the config / policies.

    Set high watermark level:

    This value determines how many actions of started device
    workers are allowed in parallel (i.e. how many workers
    are able to perform actions affecting the system in
    parallel).
    This setting is suppose to address issues with high load
    of netlink buffer, since each action can potentially
    cause 1 or more netlink events being transmitted.

    Change as per your system need.
    Default set to 20.
